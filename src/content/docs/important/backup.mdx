title: Creating a backup of your Switch or restoring one
---

import { Card, Steps, FileTree, Tabs, TabItem, Badge } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"

This section will go over how you can go about creating a backup of your Switch or restoring one. There are 2 methods to do this:

1. **Switch Method** <Badge text="Recommended" variant="success" />
    - Make a backup directly on the microSD card in the Switch. Requires at least 32GB ( or 64GB for **OLED** ) of free space.
2. **PC Method**
    - Make a backup using your PC, bypasses storing to the microSD. Only recommended for those with small microSD cards not big enough for a backup.
    - Only works on **Windows**, so your device will need Windows or you'll need to run Windows inside of a **virtual machine** or **Docker** or whatever else works.

### Requirements

---

- This section requires you to either have an **unpatched V1** Switch or a **patched V1**, **V2**, **lite** or **OLED** with **a modchip**, otherwise this will **not** work.
- This section requires you to know how to get into Hekate and for Hekate to be installed on your device for the Switch method.
  - If this is **not** the case, follow <u>[RCM & Hekate](/important/rcm/)</u> first.
- This section requires you to know how you can access your microSD card to set it up.
  - If this is **not** the case, read <u>[Browse microSD card](/miscellaneous/browse/)</u> first.

                <Steps>
                    1.  ###### Backing up

                        Boot into Hekate.

                        Press on the ```Tools``` tab.

                        Pick the ```Backup eMMC``` option.

                        Pick the ```eMMC RAW GPP``` option.

                        Once done, press ```Backup eMMC``` again but pick the ```eMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1``` option this time.

                    2.  ###### Finishing up

                        Once done, your backup should be in a folder named ```Backup``` on the root of your microSD card.

                        Move this folder to your PC, laptop or any other storage device so you don't lose it.

                        :::caution[Caution]
                        Make sure this is somewhere safe and make sure you don't lose it, losing this backup will mean you have no point to revert to if anything goes wrong!
                        :::
                        :::note[Backups]
                        It is highly recommended to make backups regularly, whether this be every day, month, 6 months or a year is up to you.
                        This way, in the case that anything might happen, you have a recent-ish backup to fall back on.
                        :::

                You have now successfully backed up your Switch!

                <Steps>
                    1.  ###### Retrieving backup

                        Take the ```Backup``` folder you have stored safely somewhere and move it back to the root of your microSD card.

                        Move all files that are inside of ```/bootloader/``` to ```/bootloader/restore/```.
                            - If this folder doesn't exist, create it:

                        <FileTree>
                            - atmosphere/
                            - bootloader/
                                - restore/
                                    - **your backup**
                            - switch/
                            - hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x.bin
                            - exosphere.ini
                            - hbmenu.nro
                        </FileTree>

                    2.  ###### Restoring backup

                        Boot into Hekate.

                        Press on the ```Tools``` tab.

                        Pick the ```Restore eMMC``` option.

                        Pick the ```eMMC RAW GPP``` option.

                        Once done, press ```Restore eMMC``` again but pick the ```eMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1``` option this time.

                    3.  ###### Finishing up

                        Once done, close out of Hekate.
