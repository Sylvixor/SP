title: Creating a backup of your Switch or restoring one
---

This section will go over how you can go about creating a backup of your Switch or restoring one. There are 2 methods to do this:

1. **Switch Method**
    - This method is highly recommended.
2. **PC Method**
    - This method is only recommended for those with a small microSD card and are unable to create a backup due to their storage size.

        ### Creating a backup

        ---

        1. Extract ```hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x_Nyx_x.x.x.zip``` into your microSD card.
        2. Boot into Hekate.
        3. Press on the ```Tools``` tab.
        4. Pick the ```Backup eMMC``` option.
        5. Pick the ```eMMC RAW GPP``` option.
        6. Once done, press ```Backup eMMC``` again but pick the ```eMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1``` option this time.
        7. Once done, your backup should be in a folder named ```Backup``` on the root of your microSD card.
        8. Move this folder to your PC, laptop or any other storage device so you don't lose it.
            - Make sure that you don't lose this folder as it will mean losing your backup.

        Now you have successfully backed up your Switch!

        :::note[Backups]
        It is highly recommended to make backups regularly, whether this be every day, month, 6 months or a year is up to you.
        This way, in the case that anything might happen, you have a recent-ish backup to fall back on.

        ### Restoring a backup

        ---

        1. Take the ```Backup``` folder you have stored safely somewhere and move it back to the root of your microSD card.
        2. Move all files that are inside of ```/bootloader/``` to ```/bootloader/restore/```.
            - If this folder doesn't exist, create it.
        3. Boot into Hekate.
        4. Press on the ```Tools``` tab.
        5. Pick the ```Restore eMMC``` option.
        6. Pick the ```eMMC RAW GPP``` option.
        7. Once done, press ```Restore eMMC``` again but pick the ```eMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1``` option this time.
        8. Once done, close out of Hekate.

        Now you have successfully restored a backup of your Switch!
