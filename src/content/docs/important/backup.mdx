title: Creating a backup of your Switch or restoring one
---

import { Badge } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

This section will go over how you can go about creating a backup of your Switch or restoring one. There are 2 methods to do this:

1. **Switch Method** <Badge text="Recommended" variant="success" />
    - Make a backup directly on the microSD card in the Switch. Require at least 32GB (or 64GB for OLED) of free space.
2. **PC Method**
    - Make a backup using your PC, bypasses storing to the microSD. Only recommended for those with small microSD card that is not enough for a backup.

        ---

        <Card title="Hekate">
            From their **Github**.
        </Card>

        ### Creating a backup

        ---

        1. Extract ```hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x_Nyx_x.x.x.zip``` into your microSD card.
        2. Boot into Hekate.
        3. Press on the ```Tools``` tab.
        4. Pick the ```Backup eMMC``` option.
        5. Pick the ```eMMC RAW GPP``` option.
        6. Once done, press ```Backup eMMC``` again but pick the ```eMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1``` option this time.
        7. Once done, your backup should be in a folder named ```Backup``` on the root of your microSD card.
        8. Move this folder to your PC, laptop or any other storage device so you don't lose it.
            - Make sure that you don't lose this folder as it will mean losing your backup.

            **You have now successfully backed up your Switch!**

        :::note[Backups]
        It is highly recommended to make backups regularly, whether this be every day, month, 6 months or a year is up to you.
        This way, in the case that anything might happen, you have a recent-ish backup to fall back on.

        ### Restoring a backup

        ---

        1. Take the ```Backup``` folder you have stored safely somewhere and move it back to the root of your microSD card.
        2. Move all files that are inside of ```/bootloader/``` to ```/bootloader/restore/```.
            - If this folder doesn't exist, create it.
        3. Boot into Hekate.
        4. Press on the ```Tools``` tab.
        5. Pick the ```Restore eMMC``` option.
        6. Pick the ```eMMC RAW GPP``` option.
        7. Once done, press ```Restore eMMC``` again but pick the ```eMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1``` option this time.
        8. Once done, close out of Hekate.

            **You have now successfully restored a backup of your Switch!**
