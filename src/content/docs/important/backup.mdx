title: Creating a backup of your Switch or restoring one
---

This section will go over how you can go about creating a backup of your Switch or restoring one. There are 2 methods to do this:

1. **Switch Method** <Badge text="Recommended" variant="success" />
    - Make a backup directly on the microSD card in the Switch. Requires at least 32GB ( or 64GB for OLED ) of free space.
2. **PC Method ( Windows )**
    - Make a backup using your PC, bypasses storing to the microSD. Only recommended for those with small microSD cards not big enough for a backup.
    - Only works on **Windows**, so your device will need Windows or you'll need to run Windows inside of a **virtual machine** or **Docker** or whatever else works.

                    1.  ###### Download: ( skip if already done )

                        <Card title = "Hekate" icon = "external">
                            ```hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x_Nyx_x.x.x.zip```

                            From their **Github**.
                        </Card>

                    2.  ###### MicroSD setup ( skip if already done )

                        Extract ```hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x_Nyx_x.x.x.zip``` into your microSD card.

                    3.  ###### Backing up

                        Boot into Hekate.

                        Press on the ```Tools``` tab.

                        Pick the ```Backup eMMC``` option.

                        Pick the ```eMMC RAW GPP``` option.

                        Once done, press ```Backup eMMC``` again but pick the ```eMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1``` option this time.

                    4.  ###### Finishing up

                        Once done, your backup should be in a folder named ```Backup``` on the root of your microSD card.

                        Move this folder to your PC, laptop or any other storage device so you don't lose it.

                        :::caution[Caution]
                        Make sure this is somewhere safe and make sure you don't lose it, losing this backup will mean you have no point to revert to if anything goes wrong!

                        It is highly recommended to make backups regularly, whether this be every day, month, 6 months or a year is up to you.
                        This way, in the case that anything might happen, you have a recent-ish backup to fall back on.

                        </Card>

                    2.  ###### MicroSD setup ( skip if already done )

                        Extract ```hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x_Nyx_x.x.x.zip``` into your microSD card.

                    3.  ###### Retrieve backup

                        Take the ```Backup``` folder you have stored safely somewhere and move it back to the root of your microSD card.

                        Move all files that are inside of ```/bootloader/``` to ```/bootloader/restore/```.

                        If this folder doesn't exist, create it:

                        <FileTree>
                            - atmosphere/
                            - bootloader/
                                - restore/
                                    - **your backup**
                            - switch/
                            - hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x.bin
                            - hekate_ipl.ini
                            - exosphere.ini
                            - hbmenu.nro
                        </FileTree>

                    4.  ###### Restoring backup

                        Boot into Hekate.

                        Press on the ```Tools``` tab.

                        Pick the ```Restore eMMC``` option.

                        Pick the ```eMMC RAW GPP``` option.

                        Once done, press ```Restore eMMC``` again but pick the ```eMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1``` option this time.

                    5.  ###### Finishing up

                        Once done, close out of Hekate.
