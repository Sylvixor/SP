title: Creating a backup of your Switch or restoring one
---

This section will go over how you can go about creating a backup of your Switch or restoring one. There are 2 methods to do this:

1. **Switch Method**
    - This method is highly recommended.
2. **PC Method**
    - This method is only recommended for those with a small microSD card and are unable to create a backup due to their storage size.
