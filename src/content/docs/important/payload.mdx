This section will go over how to launch a payload of your choice on your Switch.

### Requirements

---

- This section requires you to either have an **unpatched V1** Switch or a **patched V1**, **V2**, **lite** or **OLED** with **a modchip**, otherwise this will **not** work.
- This section requires you to have Atmosphere as well Hekate to be installed and for you to know how to access them.
  - If this is not the case, start by reading from <u>[FAQ](/introduction/faq/)</u>.

        <Steps>
            1.  ###### Entering RCM

                To start, place your microSD card inside of your Switch, take off the right joycon and put the RCM JIG on the right rail and slide it all the way down.

                If the Switch is on, turn it off and then power it back on while holding the ```Vol +``` button, this should result in just a black screen.

                If you have a black screen, it means you're in RCM mode and your Switch is ready to inject.

                :::note[Note]
                If, when injecting, nothing happens, your unit may be patched, check [possibly patched](/homebrewing/possibly-patched/).
                :::

            2. ###### Check

                Make sure that you have your preferred payload downloaded locally on your device at this point, this payload file should end in ```.bin```.
