This section will go over how you can update or downgrade your Switch, completely. There are some things you can update, including:

- **Firmware** ( most important ).
- **Hekate**.
- **Atmosphere**.
- **Sigpatches**.
- **Sysmodules** ( doesn't apply for everyone ).

### Tips

---

- It is not always required to update your firmware. When you update to a new firmware too quickly, you run the risk of Atmosphere and such not working because they haven't been updated to support the new firmware yet. Before updating, make sure that the firmware you're updating to is old enough for it to be supported by most things.
- It is recommended to dump your current firmware before upgrading, because in the case that something you use does not support the firmware you're updating to, you can always downgrade.
    - Read <u>[Dump firmware](/important/firmware/)</u>.
- It is recommended to update everything every once in a while, new games often require higher firmwares than the last.

### Requirements

---

- This section requires you to either have an **unpatched V1** Switch or a **patched V1**, **V2**, **lite** or **OLED** with **a modchip**, otherwise this will **not** work.
- This section requires you to have Atmosphere as well Hekate to be installed and for you to know how to access them.
  - If this is not the case, start by reading from <u>[FAQ](/introduction/faq/)</u>.

### Steps
