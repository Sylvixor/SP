title: Browsing your microSD card using a PC or laptop
---

import { Card, Steps, FileTree, Tabs, TabItem, Badge } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"

This section will go over how you can browse your microSD card without having to take it out of the Switch.
This is the recommended way to do things in regards to your microSD card.
The reason for this is because the microSD card reader inside of the Switch is fragile and you may risk damage if you keep taking your microSD card in and out.

There are 3 methods how you can browse your SD card using a cable:

- **Haze**
    - Haze is built into AMS, making it not needed to install anything else.
- **Hekate**
    - Using Hekate doesn't require you to go into AMS or even have it installed.
- **DBI**
    - DBI is a great option for browsing your microSD card, because DBI has a lot of tools for everything you'd want to do in your emuMMC.

### Requirements

---

- This section requires you to either have an **unpatched V1** Switch or a **patched V1**, **V2**, **lite** or **OLED** with **a modchip**, otherwise this will **not** work.
- This section requires you to know how to get into Hekate and for Hekate to be installed on your device.
  - If this is **not** the case, follow <u>[RCM & Hekate](/important/rcm/)</u> first.

        - This method won't allow you to update AMS via USB. However, it can be used from the homebrew menu.

        1. Launch the homebrew menu.
            - There are 2 ways to launch the homebrew menu:
                - Launch any game on the homescreen while holding R.
                - Launch the album.
        2. Connect your Switch to your PC / laptop using a cable.
        3. A new drive called ```Nintendo Switch``` should now shop up in your file explorer.
        4. Access the drive, now you can browse your microSD card without having to take it out.
