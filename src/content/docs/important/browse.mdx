This section will go over how you can browse your microSD card without having to take it out of the Switch.
This is the recommended way to do things in regards to your microSD card.
The reason for this is because the microSD card reader inside of the Switch is fragile and you may risk damage if you keep taking your microSD card in and out.

There are 3 methods how you can browse your SD card using a cable:

- **Haze**
    - Haze is built into AMS, making it not needed to install anything else.
    - Requires Atmosphere to be installed.
- **Hekate**
    - Using Hekate doesn't require you to go into AMS or even have it installed.
    - Requires Hekate to be installed.
- **DBI**
    - DBI is a great option for browsing your microSD card, because DBI has a lot of tools for everything you'd want to do in your emuMMC.
    - Requires DBI to be installed inside of Atmosphere.

### Requirements

---

- This section requires you to either have an **unpatched V1** Switch or a **patched V1**, **V2**, **lite** or **OLED** with **a modchip**, otherwise this will **not** work.
- This section requires you to have Atmosphere as well Hekate to be installed and for you to know how to access them.
  - If this is not the case, start by reading from <u>[FAQ](/introduction/faq/)</u>.

            This method won't allow you to update AMS via USB since you need to be inside of AMS to use it.
