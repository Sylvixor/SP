This section will go over how you can dump your titles, both from the gamecard reader for physical copies or from the e-shop for copies bought online.

**DBI** is required to do this.

If you are on MacOS, please install something like OpenMTP in order to enable MTP functionality.

### Requirements

---

- This section requires you to either have an **unpatched V1** Switch or a **patched V1**, **V2**, **lite** or **OLED** with **a modchip**, otherwise this will **not** work.
- This section requires you to have Atmosphere as well Hekate to be installed and for you to know how to access them.
    - If this is not the case, start by reading from <u>[FAQ](/introduction/faq/)</u>.

### Steps

---

<Steps>
    1.  ###### Start

        Connect your Switch to your PC or laptop using a USB cable.

        On your Switch, launch the homebrew menu and launch ```DBI```.
        - There are 2 ways of launching the homebrew menu:
            - Launch any game on the homescreen while holding R. <Badge text="Recommended" variant="success" />
            - Launch the album.

        Once inside of DBI, run ```MTP Responder```.

        Once it's connected, there should be a new drive in your choice of file explorer named ```Switch```.

        Continue reading with one of the two methods below, depending on whether you want to dump a physical gamecard or a game purchased online.

            2.  ###### DBI

                On your PC or laptop, inside of the microSD card, access ```4: Installed games```.

                Find the folder for your desired game and copy it to somewhere on your PC.
                - Do **NOT** copy over the ```Title [B+U+DXXXXXX].nsp``` file. For a clean dump, you should always copy over the folder or **only** the desired **B**ase, **U**pdate or **D**LC.
        </Steps>
        You have now successfully dumped your installed game(s)!
