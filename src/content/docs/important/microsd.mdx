This section will go over tips and recommendations when it comes to choosing a microSD card.

:::note[Official microSD cards]
The Switch has it's own official microSD card lineup, but you do **NOT** need these, on paper, any microSD card will do, the official microSD cards are just more expensive because they're licensed by Nintendo.

### Brands

---

Choosing a good, reliable brand is important, you do not want to buy a microSD card from an unknown brand or a brand with bad reputation.

### Models

---

Choosing a good model is important. You do not want to choose a model that's very slow or one that's so overkill it has no benefit on the Switch.

:::note[Speeds]
It's important to note that all models in the list below are fast enough to adequately take advantage of the speeds able to be read by the Switch's internal microSD card reader.

### Size

---

Choosing adequate size is also important. You do not want to run out of storage.

###### Recommended use case per storage size:

###### - 64GB
    - Bare minimum for the **V1**, **V2** and **Lite** due to the necessary space required for backups.

###### - 128GB
    - Bare minimum for the **OLED** due to the necessary space required for backups.
    - Fits an alright number of games, but don't expect too much.

###### - 256GB <Badge text="Recommended" variant="success" />
    - Nice sweet spot for most people in terms of it's price to storage ratio.
    - Fits a good number of games.

###### - 512GB
    - For people who want to fit a LOT of games on their Switch ( think 40+ ) without offloading titles.

###### - 1TB / 1.5TB / 2TB
    - Way overkill for basically everyone. Only get if you have money to burn or never want to run out of storage.
    - Lots of fakes of these sizes, so be cautious.

### Fakes

---

Lastly, it is very important to watch out for fake microSD cards.

Do **NOT** buy microSD cards second hand, do **NOT** buy microSD cards from shady places or marketplaces.

**DO** buy your microSD card from actual reputable webshops or stores in your country, or buy directly from the manufacturer themselves if possible.
This way, you can minimise the chances that you'll get a fake microSD card.

### What is so bad about fakes?

---

Fakes are often much, much slower than their real counterparts, often times do not have the advertised amount of storage on them and often times also have a higher chance of things like corruption.

In essence, you should stay away from them at all cost since they will cause you headaches and for you to have wasted your money.
