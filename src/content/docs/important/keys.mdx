This section will go over how you can dump your device's keys.

Keys are usually used for PC programs, but can also be used to fix a broken MMC when a full backup is not available. It's better to have a full backup, but this is a nice backup-backup to have just in case.

### Requirements

---

- This section requires you to either have an **unpatched V1** Switch or a **patched V1**, **V2**, **lite** or **OLED** with **a modchip**, otherwise this will **not** work.
- This section requires you to know how to get into Hekate and for Hekate to be installed on your device.
  - If this is **not** the case, follow <u>[RCM & Hekate](/important/rcm/)</u> first.
- This section requires you to know how you can access your microSD card to set it up.
  - If this is **not** the case, read <u>[Browse microSD card](/miscellaneous/browse/)</u> first.

### Steps

<Steps>
    1.  ###### Download:

        <Card title = "LockPickRCM" icon = "external">
            ---
            ```Lockpick_RCM.bin```

            From their **website**.
        </Card>

    2.  ###### MicroSD card setup

        Place ```TegraExplorer.bin``` & ```Lockpick_RCM.bin``` in ```/bootloader/payloads/``` on your microSD card:

        <FileTree>
            - atmosphere/
            - bootloader/
                - payloads/
                    - **Lockpick_RCM.bin**
            - switch/
            - hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x.bin
            - exosphere.ini
            - hbmenu.nro
        </FileTree>

    3.  ###### Hekate

        Launch into Hekate, select ```Payloads``` and select ```Lockpick_RCM.bin```.
            - You can use the ```VOL +``` & ```VOL -``` to scroll up and down and use the power button to confirm your desired selection.

        Select ```Dump from sysNAND```. LockpickRCM will dump available ```prod.keys```, ```title.keys``` and ```dev.keys```.
            - Alternatively, if you have games installed on your emuNAND, you can select ```Dump from emuNAND```.
            - Mariko can also dump ```partialaes.keys``` if you select ```Dump Mariko partials```.

        Once the dumping process is done, select ```Reboot to bootloader/update.bin``` from the main menu in order to boot back into Hekate.
</Steps>

You have now successfully dumped your keys, you should now be able to find your dump in ```/switch/``` on your microSD card.

<FileTree>
    - atmosphere/
    - bootloader/
    - **switch/**
    - hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x.bin
    - exosphere.ini
    - hbmenu.nro
</FileTree>
