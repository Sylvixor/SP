This section will go over how you can go about creating a backup of your game(s) or restoring one.

There are 2 methods to which you can do this:

1. Using **DBI**.
2. Using **JKSV**.

:::note[Difference]
DBI is much simpler. You can go more in-depth with JKSV, go with whichever you prefer.

### Requirements

---

- This section requires you to either have an **unpatched V1** Switch or a **patched V1**, **V2**, **lite** or **OLED** with **a modchip**, otherwise this will **not** work.
- This section requires you to have Atmosphere as well Hekate to be installed and for you to know how to access them.
  - If this is not the case, start by reading from <u>[FAQ](/introduction/faq/)</u>.

### Steps

<Steps>
    1.  ###### First ( Skip if already done )

                <Steps>
                    1.  ###### Start

                        Connect your Switch to your PC or laptop using a USB cable.

                        On your Switch, launch the homebrew menu and launch ```DBI```.
                        - There are 2 ways of launching the homebrew menu:
                            - Launch any game on the homescreen while holding R. <Badge text="Recommended" variant="success" />
                            - Launch the album.

                    2.  ###### Backup process

                        Inside of DBI, run ```MTP Responder```.

                        There should now be a new drive named ```Switch``` inside of your choice of file explorer.

                        Access the drive and access the ```7: Saves``` folder.

                        Copy over both of the folders titled ```Installed games``` and ```Uninstalled games``` to somewhere on your PC or laptop.
                </Steps>
                You have now successfully backed up all of the saves of your games!
