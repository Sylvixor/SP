This section will go over how you can go about creating a backup of your game(s) or restoring one.

There are 2 methods to which you can do this:

1. Using **DBI**.
2. Using **JKSV**.

:::note[Difference]
DBI is much simpler. You can go more in-depth with JKSV, go with whichever you prefer.

<Steps>
    1.  ###### First ( Skip if already done )
        Download either **DBI** or **JKSV** from their Github.

        Then install either one of them onto your Switch.
        - Read [Install homebrew apps](/miscellaneous/homebrew/) on how to do it if you don't already know.
</Steps>
