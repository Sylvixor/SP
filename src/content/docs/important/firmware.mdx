This section will go over how you can dump your device's firmware.

---

### Requirements

---

- This section requires you to either have an **unpatched V1** Switch or a **patched V1**, **V2**, **lite** or **OLED** with **a modchip**, otherwise this will **not** work.
- This section requires you to know how to get into Hekate and for Hekate to be installed on your device.
    - If this is **not** the case, follow <u>[RCM & Hekate](/important/rcm/)</u> first.
- This section requires you to know how you can access your microSD card to set it up.
    - If this is **not** the case, read <u>[Browse microSD card](/miscellaneous/browse/)</u> first.

            1.  ###### Download:
                <Card title = "TegraExplorer" icon = "external">
                    ---
                    ```TegraExplorer.bin```

                    From their **Github**.
                </Card>
                <Card title = "LockPickRCM" icon = "external">
                    ---
                    ```Lockpick_RCM.bin```

                    From their **website**.
                </Card>

            2.  ###### MicroSD card setup

                Place ```TegraExplorer.bin``` & ```Lockpick_RCM.bin``` in ```/bootloader/payloads/``` on your microSD card:

                <FileTree>
                    - atmosphere/
                    - bootloader/
                        - payloads/
                            - **Lockpick_RCM.bin**
                            - **TegraExplorer.bin**
                    - switch/
                    - hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x.bin
                    - exosphere.ini
                    - hbmenu.nro
                </FileTree>

            3.  ###### Hekate

                Launch into Hekate, select ```Payloads``` and select ```Lockpick_RCM.bin```.

                Once in Lockpick, select ```Dump from sysNAND```.
                    - You can use the ```VOL +``` & ```VOL -``` to scroll up and down and use the power button to confirm your desired selection.

                Once the dumping process is done, return to the main menu and select ```Reboot to Hekate```.

            4.  ###### Hekate ( again )

                Once in Hekate again, select ```Payloads``` and select ```TegraExplorer.bin``` this time.

                Once in TegraExplorer, select ```FirmwareDump.te```.
                    - You can use the ```VOL +``` & ```VOL -``` to scroll up and down and use the power button to confirm your desired selection.

                Once the dumping process is done, select ```Reboot to bootloader/update.bin``` from the main menu in order to boot back into Hekate.
        </Steps>

        You have now successfully dumped your firmware, you should now be able to find your dump in ```/tegraexplorer/Firmware/xx.x.x/``` on your microSD card.
