This section will go over everything overclocking related when it comes to Erista Switches.

### Erista Limits

---

##### CPU:
- Erista CPU limit of 15A is reached at **1785MHz** without any UV.

##### GPU:
- The Erista GPU limit of 15A is reached at **921MHz** without any UV with moderate speedos.

##### Charger IC:
- 18W limit restricts overclocking for Erista units. This is the main limiting factor, but the PMIC current limits for CPU and GPU will be reached first.

##### GPU Scheduling:
- On: Caps GPU usage at ~96.7%
- Off: Caps GPU usage at ~99.7%

:::danger[Note]
Disabling GPU Scheduling will slightly increase power draw. Use it with caution.
