This section will go over everything overclocking related when it comes to Erista Switches.

:::note[Stability Testing]
At a few points in this guide, you'll have to test undervolts / overclocks. To test stability, read <u>[Test stability](/overclocking/stability/)</u>
once you've read through this section.

### Erista Limits

---

##### CPU
- Erista CPU limit of 15A is reached at **1785MHz** without any UV.

##### GPU
- The Erista GPU limit of 15A is reached at **921MHz** without any UV with moderate speedos.

##### Charger IC
- 18W limit restricts overclocking for Erista units. This is the main limiting factor, but the PMIC current limits for CPU and GPU will be reached first.

##### GPU Scheduling
- On: Caps GPU usage at ~96.7%
- Off: Caps GPU usage at ~99.7%

:::danger[Note]
Disabling GPU Scheduling will slightly increase power draw. Use it with caution.

### Settings for EOS Switchcraft

##### CPU Settings

|                    |                                           |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Boost clock**    | 2091MHz if you use UV3, otherwise 1785MHz |
| **Undervolt mode** | Use the highest setting that is stable    |
| **Vmin**           | 800mv                                     |
| **Voltage limit**  | 1225mv                                    |

:::note[Exact settings]
"Use the highest setting that is stable" means you just pick the highest option that is stable.

Will require some trial and error.

##### GPU Settings

|                    |                                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Undervolt mode** | 2                                      |
| **Vmin**           | 740 - 780mv                            |
| **Voltage offset** | Use the highest setting that is stable |

:::note[Exact settings]
For Vmin, use the lowest setting that is stable.

Will require some trial and error.

##### RAM Settings

|                 |                                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| **DRAM Timing** | AUTO_ADJ_HP                       |
| **DVB Shift**   | Only increase if RAM is unstable  |
