This section will go over everything overclocking related when it comes to Mariko Switches.

### Mariko Limits

---

##### CPU:
- 5A limit reached at **2397MHz** (CPU UV1) or **2295MHz**  (< 1650 CPU speedo).

:::note[Note]
Use higher UV levels to avoid exceeding the PMIC limit.
:::

##### GPU:
- 10A limit reached at **1228MHz** (GPU UV1) with moderate speedos (1650).

:::note[Note]
Disabling GPU scheduling overloads the PMIC, potentially causing damage.
:::

##### Charger IC:
- 18W limit restricts overclocking for both Erista and Mariko units (12W on Switch Lite). This is the main limiting factor, but the PMIC current limits for CPU and GPU will be reached first.

##### GPU Scheduling:
- On: Caps GPU usage at ~96.7%
- Off: Caps GPU usage at ~99.7%

:::danger[Note]
Disabling GPU Scheduling will slightly increase power draw. Use it with caution.
