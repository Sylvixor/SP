This section will go over how you can go about overclocking your Switch in order to get a higher and / or more stable framerate.

### Before you start

:::danger[Warning]
Overclocking carries inherent risk. If done incorrectly, it could cause damage.

By proceeding, you accept full responsibility for any consequences. We are not liable for any damage, data loss, or bricking that may occur as a result of overclocking.

- This section requires you to either have an **unpatched V1** Switch or a **patched V1**, **V2**, **lite** or **OLED** with **a modchip**, otherwise this will **not** work.
- This section requires you to have Atmosphere as well Hekate to be installed and for you to know how to access them.
    - If this is not the case, start by reading from <u>[FAQ](/introduction/faq/)</u>
- This section requires you to know the different ways of accessing your microSD card.
    - If this is not the case, start by reading <u>[Browse microSD card](/important/browse/)</u>

### Create a backup

---

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label = "SysMMC / SysNAND">
        1. Go into Hekate and navigate to the ```Tools``` section, then select ```Backup eMMC```.
        2. Create a backup of ```eMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1```.
        3. Back up the ```eMMC RAW GPP``` partition.

        ---
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label = "EmuMMC / EmuNAND">
        1. Go into Hekate and navigate to the ```Tools``` section, then select ```Backup eMMC```.
        2. To back up your emuNAND, enable the option for ```SD emuMMC Raw Partition```.
        3. Create a backup of ```eMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1```.
        4. Back up the ```eMMC RAW GPP``` partition.

        ---
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

A backup will now be created on the root of your microSD card with the name ```backup```. Put this folder somewhere safe.

:::danger[Overclocking Software]
**Never** use 4IFIR.

It can damage your Switch without warning among other issues. Always use Sys-Clk-OC ( Included in EOS ).
:::

:::caution[Power Usage]
**Never** go over 8w in handheld, unless you want to risk damaging your battery, which is why you need to undervolt ( UV ) before overclocking ( OC ).

Erista reaches 8w a lot quicker than Mariko, if you go over 8w you will have to plug your system in to avoid damage.
Plugged in, the limits for power usage are much higher, but will still vary from model to model.
