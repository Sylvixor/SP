This section will go over how you can go about overclocking your Switch in order to get a higher and / or more stable framerate.

### Before you start

---

- You need to have followed the guide to install CFW on either your emunand, sysnand, or both.
    - See <u>[Homebrewable?](/introduction/homebrewable/)</u>.

- Back up your emunand, sysnand, or both:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label = "SysNAND">
        1. Go into Hekate and navigate to the ```Tools``` section, then select ```Backup eMMC```.
        2. Create a backup of ```eMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1```.
        3. Back up the ```eMMC RAW GPP``` partition.

        ---
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label = "EmuNAND">
        1. Go into Hekate and navigate to the ```Tools``` section, then select ```Backup eMMC```.
        2. To back up your emuNAND, enable the option for ```SD emuMMC Raw Partition```.
        3. Create a backup of ```eMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1```.
        4. Back up the ```eMMC RAW GPP``` partition.

        ---
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

A backup will now be created on the root of your microSD card with the name ```Backup```. Put this folder somewhere safe.
