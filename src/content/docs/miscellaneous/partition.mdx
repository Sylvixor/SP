This section will go over the differences between a partition-based and a file-based EmuNAND.

---

### TLDR

---

**Partition-based is highly recommended.**

### Differences

---

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label = "Partition-based">
        Pros:
        - Has the least chance of corruption.
        - Higher performance.

        Cons:
        - Creating an emuNAND requires the microSD card to be partitioned, in other words, the card will get wiped.
        - Migrating to a new microSD card or backing up your current one is more complex.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label = "File-based">
        Pros:
        - Easy to migrate or backup.
        - Creating an emuNAND is easier and doesn't require a backup.

        Cons:
        - Lower performance.
        - Higher chance of corruption.
        - Transferring games between your SD card and emuNAND via system settings is **not** possible.
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
