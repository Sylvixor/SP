import { Badge, Tabs, TabItem, Card, Steps, FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

This sectionw will go over how you can migrate from SX OS to Atmosphere. The reason for this is that SX OS has not been updated for a very long time and will never be updated again.
It is good practice to switch over to Atmosphere as soon as possible.

#### Requirements

---

- This section requires you to either have an **unpatched V1** Switch or a **patched V1**, **V2**, **lite** or **OLED** with **a modchip**, otherwise this will **not** work.
- This section requires you to have Atmosphere as well Hekate to be installed and for you to know how to access them.
    - If this is not the case, start by reading from <u>[FAQ](/introduction/faq/)</u>.
- This section requires you to know the different ways of accessing your microSD card.
    - If this is not the case, start by reading <u>[Browse microSD card](/important/browse/)</u>.

:::note[For Mariko users]
If you updated via ChoiDujourNX on your sysMMC then you have to either get a donor boot0/boot1 or use a backup of your sysMMC boot0/boot1 and then 
restore it via NxNandManager, hekate, or sxos bootmenu. This is because ChoiDuJourNX corrupts your boot0/boot1 and will prevent you from 
being able to boot into sysMMC on Atmosphere.

### Steps

<Steps>
    1.  ###### CFW files

        Extract the following files into the root of your microSD card.
        <Card title = "SX_Gear_v1.1.zip" icon = "external">
        ---
        SX Core / Lite & SX Pro users only.

        Make sure to overwrite your current ```boot.dat``` file.
        </Card>
        <Card title = "hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x_Nyx_x.x.x.zip" icon = "external">
        ---
        From their **Github**.
        </Card>
        <Card title = "atmosphere-x.x.x-master.zip" icon = "external">
        ---

        From their **Github**.
        </Card>
        <Card title = "patch-1.9.0-20.zip" icon = "external">
        ---
        </Card>

        Rename ```hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x.bin``` to ```payload.bin``` ( SX Core / Lite, SX Pro and Spacecraft-NX users ).

    2.  ###### Hekate launch options

        Create a file named ```hekate_ipl.ini``` inside of your ```/bootloader/``` folder.

        Copy and paste the following configuration within the file:

        ```
        [config]
        autoboot=0
        autoboot_list=0
        bootwait=3
        backlight=100
        autohosoff=0
        autonogc=1
        updater2p=1
        bootprotect=0

        [CFW emuMMC - Atmosphere]
        pkg3=atmosphere/package3
        emummcforce=1
        cal0blank=1
        kip1patch=nosigchk
        icon=bootloader/res/icon_payload.bmp

        [CFW sysMMC - Atmosphere]
        pkg3=atmosphere/package3
        emummc_force_disable=1
        icon=bootloader/res/icon_payload.bmp

        [Stock]
        pkg3=atmosphere/package3
        stock=1
        emummc_force_disable=1
        icon=bootloader/res/icon_switch.bmp
        ```

    3.  ###### Blank serial info

        Create a file named ```exosphere.ini``` in the root of your microSD card.

        Copy and paste the following configuration within the file:

        ```
        [exosphere]
        debugmode=1
        debugmode_user=0
        disable_user_exception_handlers=0
        enable_user_pmu_access=0
        blank_prodinfo_sysmmc=0
        blank_prodinfo_emummc=1
        allow_writing_to_cal_sysmmc=0
        log_port=0
        log_baud_rate=115200
        log_inverted=0
        ```

    4.  ###### Blocking Nintendo connections

        Create a file named ```default.txt``` in ```/atmosphere/hosts/``` ( the ```/hosts/``` folder won't exist, so create it ).

        Copy and paste the following configuation within the file:

        ```
        # Block Nintendo Servers
        127.0.0.1 *nintendo.*
        127.0.0.1 *nintendo-europe.com
        127.0.0.1 *nintendoswitch.*
        95.216.149.205 *conntest.nintendowifi.net
        95.216.149.205 *ctest.cdn.nintendo.net
        ```

        :::note[Note]
        If you want to use Atmosphere on sysMMC as well, rename the file to ```emummc.txt```.
        :::

    5.  ###### Finishing up

        Place your microSD card back into your Switch, power it on and boot into Hekate.

        Select ```emuMMC``` in the main menu, then select ```Migrate emuMMC``` and finally select ```emunand```.

        Once it's done, select ```Close```.

        Click on ```launch```, and select your CFW launch option.

        :::note[sysMMC > emuMMC & emuMMC > sysMMC]
        To switch between sysMMC and emuMMC, just go back into hekate's launch options in order to select either sysMMC or emuMMC.
