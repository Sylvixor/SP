import { Badge } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

This section will go over the differences between a partition-based and a file-based EmuNAND.

---

### Partition-based <Badge text="Recommended" variant="success" />

---

Pros:
- Has the least chance of corruption.
- Higher performance.

Cons:
- Creating an emuNAND requires the microSD card to be partitioned, in other words, the card will get wiped.
- Migrating to a new microSD card or backing up your current one is more complex.

### File-based

---

Pros:
- Easy to migrate or backup.
- Creating an emuNAND is easier and doesn't require a backup.

Cons:
- Lower performance.
- Higher chance of corruption.
- Transferring games between your SD card and emuNAND via system settings is **not** possible.
