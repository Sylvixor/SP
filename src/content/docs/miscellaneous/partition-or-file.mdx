title: Partition-based or file-based emuMMC / emuNAND?
---

This section will go over the differences between a partition based and a file based EmuNAND.

---

:::note[Recommended choice]
It is highly recommended to use a partition based emuNAND because of it's better performance and lower chance of corruption.
:::

### Partition based

---

Pros:
- Has the least chance of corruption.
- Higher performance.

Cons:
- Creating an emuNAND requires the microSD card to be partitioned, in other words, the card will get wiped.
- Migrating to a new microSD card or backing up your current one is more complex.

### File based

---

Pros:
- Easy to migrate or backup.
- Creating an emuNAND is easier and doesn't require a backup.

Cons:
- Lower performance.
- Higher chance of corruption.
- Transferring games between your SD card and emuNAND via system settings is not possible.
