title: About the SP guide
---

The reason we decided to make this guide is because the guide that was used originally ( which was hosted on Rentry ) got taken down.
That page still hasn't been updated, it has been reuploaded on Gitlab, but it's far, far from ideal when trying to read.
Which is why we wanted to make a clear, concise guide that educates you over as much as possible that there is to know about Switch homebrewing and also help anyone new to the subject homebrew, the right way.
