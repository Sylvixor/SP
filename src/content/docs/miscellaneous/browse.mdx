title: Browsing microSD card using USB
---

This section will go over how you can browse your microSD card without having to take it out of the Switch.
This is the recommended way to do things in regards to your microSD card.
The reason for this is because the microSD card reader inside of the Switch is fragile and you may risk damage if you keep taking your microSD card in and out.

There are 3 methods how you can browse your SD card using a cable.
