### Steps

---

<Steps>
    1.  ###### Download:
        <Card title = "Amiigo" icon = "external">
            ---
            ```Amiigo.nro```

            From their **Github**.
        </Card>

    2.  ###### MicroSD card setup

        Access your microSD card by the method of your choice and place ```Amiigo.nro``` inside the ```/switch/``` folder on the root of your microSD card.

        <FileTree>
            - atmosphere/
            - bootloader/
            - switch/
                - **Amiigo.nro**
            - hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x.bin
            - exosphere.ini
            - hbmenu.nro
        </FileTree>

    3.  ###### Atmosphere

        On your Switch, launch the homebrew menu and launch ```Amiigo```.
        - There are 2 ways of launching the homebrew menu:
            - Launch any game on the homescreen while holding R. <Badge text="Recommended" variant="success" />
            - Launch the album.

    4.  ###### Amiigo

        Select the ```Amiigo Store``` tab.

        From there, select the franchise that your amiibo stems from and pick your desired amiibo.

        Your chosen amiibo will now be in the ```My Amiibo``` tab.

        Press the home button and launch any game of your choice.

        Once you're at a point in the game where it's ready to access amiibos, press the home button.

        Launch the homebrew menu again but this time by selecting the album because a game is already being ran.

        Launch Amiigo, activate your created amiibo in the ```My Amiibo``` tab by highlighting it and pressing ```A```.

        Press the home button again and go back into the game of your choice that was running.

        Your chosen amiibo should now activate!

        :::caution[Offline]
        You can also activate amiibos while offline, but in order to update the database of current amiibos you will need to be connected to the internet.
