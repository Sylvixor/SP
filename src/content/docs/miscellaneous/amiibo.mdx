        - There are 2 ways of launching the homebrew menu:
            - Launch any game on the homescreen while holding R. <Badge text="Recommended" variant="success" />
            - Launch the album.

    4.  ###### AmiiboGenerator

        Select all amiibos you want to generate. You can select all Amiibo by pressing ```ZL``` and going through the pages.

        After you have selected all Amiibo you want, press ```X``` to generate all selected Amiibo.

        :::note[Network]

        :::

        Once generated, exit out of AmiiboGenerator.

    5.  ###### Emuiibo

        Enter your overlay and enter ```emuiibo``` and press ```R``` to enable Amiibo emulation.

        Enter any game of your choice.

        Enter ```View virtual amiibos``` and select the Amiibo of your choice.

        In-game, access the way to activate Amiibo and the selected Amiibo should be used immediately.

        Now you have emulated Amiibo!
