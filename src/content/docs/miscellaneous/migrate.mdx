This section will go over how you can migrate to another microSD card. This could happen because you want more storage for more games or your current microSD card just doesn't perform the way you want it to.
Either way, this section will go over how you can safely migrate to a new microSD card without having to start from scratch.

                and ```BOOT1``` files into the ```restore``` folder.

                Afterwards, move your ```backup```, ```emummc``` and ```bootloader``` folders onto your PC / laptop.

            5.  ###### Hekate once again
