            1.  ###### MicroSD card

                Access your microSD card, either with a reader or using an USB.

            2.  ###### Configuration

                Navigate to the ```/atmosphere/config/``` folder.

                Open ```stratosphere.ini``` with any text editor.

                If you do not have a file named ```stratosphere.ini``` in this directory, copy it over from ```/atmosphere/config_templates```.

                You now need to add the following to the bottom of your ```stratosphere.ini``` file:
                - ```nogc = 0```.

                Save the file and ensure it is still saved as ```.ini```.

                Reinsert your microSD card into your Switch and boot AMS or just exit out of MTP.
        </Steps>
        ---

        You have now successfully enabled your gamecard reader! To disable, simply remove the ```nogc = 0``` parameter from your ```stratosphere.ini``` file.
