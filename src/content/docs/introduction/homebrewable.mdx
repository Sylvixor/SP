title: Is my Switch homebrew-able?
---

This is... complicated.

Technically speaking, every single Switch is homebrew-able, but the methods will differ depending on the model and situation.

Currently, there are two different ways to homebrew a Switch.

1. Using an RCM JIG.
2. Soldering a modchip.

The JIG is by far the easiest method, but in order to be able to use an RCM JIG to homebrew your Switch you specifically need a V1 Switch [ manufactured in 2017 - 2018 ] which is also unpatched. Only then can you use an RCM JIG.

If you have a V1 Switch and want to check whether it is unpatched or not, please refer to the image below to check:

Now, if you have an **unpatched V1** Switch, please continue to [Unpatched](/homebrewing/unpatched).

If you have a **possibly patched V1** Switch, please continue to [Possibly Patched](/homebrewing/possibly-patched).

If you have a **patched V1**, **V2**, **Lite** or **OLED** **without** a modchip, please continue to [Patched](/homebrewing/patched).

If you have a **patched V1**, **V2**, **Lite** or **OLED** but **with** a modchip, please continue to [Mariko](/homebrewing/mariko).
