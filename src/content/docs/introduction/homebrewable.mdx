title: Is my Switch homebrew-able?
---

This is... complicated.

Technically speaking, every single Switch is homebrew-able, but the methods will differ depending on the model and situation.

Currently, there are two different ways to homebrew a Switch.

1. Using an RCM JIG.
2. Soldering a modchip.

The JIG is by far the easiest method, but in order to be able to use an RCM JIG to homebrew your Switch you specifically need a V1 Switch [ manufactured in 2017 - 2018 ] which is also unpatched. Only then can you use an RCM JIG.

If you have a V1 Switch and want to check whether it is unpatched or not, please refer to the image below to check:

**V2, Lite and OLED** Switches are often referred to as **Mariko**.
