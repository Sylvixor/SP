title: Mariko
---

This section will go over homebrewing your patched V1 Switch or Mariko Switch. We will be going over setting up your microSD card, creating an emulated NAND ( emuNAND / emuMMC ) while also blocking Nintendo's servers so you don't get banned.
- In order for this method to work, you explicitly do need a Patched V1 or Mariko **with a modchip**, stock models will **not** work.

Make sure you have read the Introduction section before doing this, as it contains a lot of important information to homebrewing.

### Firstly

---

<Steps>
    1. ###### Disable cloud saves
        - To do this, go to ```Settings``` -> ```Data Management``` -> ```Save Data Cloud``` -> ```Settings``` and disable ```Automatically back up save data``` and ```Automatically download save data```.
    2. ###### Read [partition-based or file-based](/miscellaneous/partition-or-file/)
        - **TLDR:** Partition-based emuMMC is recommended because of it's lower chance of corruption and higher performance, despite being a little harder to back up.
    3. ###### Backup
        - Make sure you have backed up anything on the microSD card if the card has been used beforehand, because following this guide **will** wipe the microSD card.
</Steps>

### MicroSD Card Setup

---

###### For the initial setup you will need:

- This ( fantastic ) guide. **:)**
- A patched V1 Switch or Mariko Switch **with a modchip**.
- A microSD card of your choice.
  - Read [microSD guide](/miscellaneous/microsd/).
- A ( micro ) SD card reader.
  - You can buy a microSD card reader, you can buy an SD card reader with a microSD to SD adapter, you can use your laptops ( micro ) SD card reader, or maybe even that microSD slot in your phone! *( Not recommended. Android will make folders in the card, which may make it look a bit messy, but it's a way! )*.

        **Whatever works, so long as you have something to access your microSD card.**

---

<Steps>
    4. ###### Download the following files:
        <Card title = "Hekate" icon = "external">
            ```hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x_Nyx_x.x.x.zip```

            From their **Github**.
        </Card>
        <Card title = "Atmosphere" icon = "external">
            ```atmosphere-x.x.x-master-xxxxxxxxx+hbl-x.x.x+hbmenu-x.x.x.zip```

            From their **Github**.
        </Card>
        <Card title = "Sigpatches" icon = "external">
            ```sigpatches.zip```

            From their **website**.
        </Card>
    5. ###### Hekate launch options

        Inside of ```/bootloader/``` on the root of your microSD card, create a file named ```hekate_ipl.ini```.
        - You will need to create a configuration file to set up parameters for Hekate.

        <FileTree>
            - atmosphere/
            - bootloader/
                - **hekate_ipl.ini** Create this file.
            - switch/
            - hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x.bin
            - hbmenu.nro
        </FileTree>

        Copy the bit below and paste it inside of ```hekate_ipl.ini```:
        - You can use the button in the top right of the box in order to copy.

        ```ini
        [config]
        autoboot=0
        autoboot_list=0
        bootwait=3
        backlight=100
        autohosoff=0
        autonogc=1
        updater2p=1
        bootprotect=0

        [CFW emuMMC - Atmosphere]
        fss0=atmosphere/package3
        emummcforce=1
        cal0blank=1
        kip1patch=nosigchk
        icon=bootloader/res/icon_payload.bmp

        [Stock]
        fss0=atmosphere/package3
        stock=1
        emummc_force_disable=1
        icon=bootloader/res/icon_switch.bmp
        ```

    6. ###### Avoiding a ban

        Inside of the root of your microSD card, create a file named ```exosphere.ini```.

        <FileTree>
            - atmosphere/
            - bootloader/
                - hekate_ipl.ini
            - switch/
            - hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x.bin
            - **exosphere.ini** Create this file.
            - hbmenu.nro
        </FileTree>

        Copy the bit below and paste it inside of ```exosphere.ini```:
        - You can use the button in the top right of the box in order to copy.

        ```ini
        [exosphere]
        debugmode=1
        debugmode_user=0
        disable_user_exception_handlers=0
        enable_user_pmu_access=0
        blank_prodinfo_sysmmc=0
        blank_prodinfo_emummc=1
        allow_writing_to_cal_sysmmc=0
        log_port=0
        log_baud_rate=115200
        log_inverted=0
        ```

    7. ###### Blocking Nintendo connections

        Inside of ```/atmosphere/hosts/``` on the root of your microSD card, create a file named ```default.txt```.

        <FileTree>
            - atmosphere/
                - hosts/
                    - **default.txt** Create this file.
            - bootloader/
                - hekate_ipl.ini
            - switch/
            - hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x.bin
            - exosphere.ini
            - hbmenu.nro
        </FileTree>

        Copy the bit below and paste it inside of ```default.txt```:
        - You can use the button in the top right of the box in order to copy.

        ```ini
        # Block Nintendo Servers
        127.0.0.1 *nintendo.*
        127.0.0.1 *nintendo-europe.com
        127.0.0.1 *nintendoswitch.*
        95.216.149.205 *conntest.nintendowifi.net
        95.216.149.205 *ctest.cdn.nintendo.net
        ```

        :::note[Note]
        You can rename the file to ```emummc.txt``` if you **only** want this to apply to emuMMC, if you rename it to ```emummc.txt``` Nintendo connections will **not** be blocked in sysMMC.

### Creating emuMMC

---

Now, you will have to choose between either a partition-based emuMMC or file-based emuMMC, you can read about the differences in [partition-based or file-based](/miscellaneous/partition-or-file/) if you still haven't done so.

**TLDR:** Partition-based emuMMC is recommended because of it's lower chance of corruption and higher performance, despite being a little harder to back up.

    8.  ###### Launching into Hekate

        In order to launch into Hekate, power off your Switch and power it on while holding ```VOL -``` in order to launch into Hekate.

        <Steps>
            9.  ###### Partitioning

                You should now be inside of Hekate. Select the ```Tools``` tab, and then select ```Partition SD card```, and then press ```Ok```.

                Move the emuMMC ( RAW ) slider until it says ```29 FULL``` ( ```59 FULL``` for **OLED** ), and then press ```Next Step```, and then press ```Start```.

                Once the operation is done, press ```Close```, and then select the ```Home``` tab.

                Select ```emuMMC``` in the main menu, and then select ```Create emuMMC```.

                Select ```SD Partition```, and then select ```Part 1```.

                Wait for your emuMMC to get created. Once it's done, press ```Close```.

                Select the ```Tools``` tab again, and then select ```Archive Bit - AutoRCM```, and then pick ```Enable AutoRCM```.
        </Steps>

### Finishing up

---

<Steps>
    11. ###### Creating backup

        It is recommended to now make a backup, please read [backup / restore](/important/backup/) in order to make a backup using Hekate since you're already in it. Kill two birds with one stone.

    12. ###### Launching Atmosphere

        On the main menu of Hekate, press ```Launch```, and then select ```emuMMC - Atmosphere CFW``` to launch emuMMC with Atmosphere.

        Otherwise, select ```Stock``` to launch OFW ( can be used for things like online play ).
</Steps>

---

Done! You have now successfully set up Atmosphere on your emuMMC.

Now, if you want to take advantage of CFW on emuMMC, it's recommended to read through:

- [Homebrew app installation](/miscellaneous/hbapp/).
- [USB installation](/miscellaneous/usb-installation/).
- [Manage cheats](/miscellaneous/cheats/).
- [Setup Tesla overlay](/miscellaneous/tesla/).
- [Install themes](/miscellaneous/themes/).
- [Emulating amiibo](/miscellaneous/emuiibo/).
