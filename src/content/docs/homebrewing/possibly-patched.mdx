### How to check

First, follow the guide for [Unpatched](/homebrewing/unpatched) like normal:

- If the injection is successful, and you boot into Hekate, your V1 Switch is **unpatched**.
- Inside of TegraRCMGui, if the injection is successful but you get the message **"Smashed the stack with a 0x0000 byte..."**, your Switch is **patched**.

### Continue

If your Switch is **unpatched**, please continue to [Unpatched](/homebrewing/unpatched).

If your Switch is **patched**, please continue to [Patched](/homebrewing/patched)
