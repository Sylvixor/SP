In the case that your V1 is patched or you have a Mariko Switch, your Switch will require a modchip to be soldered onto the motherboard of your Switch in order to homebrew.

### What now?

---

Doing this soldering job yourself is **not recommended** unless you have the necessary tools and experience to do it.

### Modchips

---

Modchips can be sourced from **Aliexpress**, just make sure you get the right model that matches the model of your Switch.
If you have a Lite, do not get a modchip meant for the OLED and vice versa.
The difference between modchip models themselves ( think PicoFly / HWFly / Instinct ) is negligible.

:::note[Listings]
Listings on Aliexpress get taken down all the time, which is why a lot of them won't have many reviews if any, do not be alarmed by this.

        :::note[Note]
        These are the recommended tools and things to install a V6 Modchip in an OLED console. Tools and things for different methods / modchips / consoles might differ.
        :::

        Look up some tutorials for methods to install the modchip of your choice in the console that you have and go from there. More than that we can't say as this is supposed to be a guide for the software side of things.

        If you do not have the necessary tools, nor the experience nor are you willing to take the risk, continue reading.

        The main way you can still homebrew your Switch is if you get someone else to do the job for you. This will cost more due to having to pay for the job but is much easier for yourself since it requires no tools nor experience.

        There are multiple ways you can find someone that may be able to install a modchip for you, including:

        - Asking around family and / or friends.
        - Looking around locally on marketplaces for anyone that does repairs.
        - Looking around locally physically for any repair shops that also do Switches.
        - Using a mail-in service from Etsy.
        - Buying a pre-modded Switch from someone selling it, either local to you or on a site like eBay, Sthetix or Etsy.

        :::note[Finding installers]
        Repair shops and / or repair people often won't advertise that they install modchips. Personally go into the store or ask the person specifically if they install modchips.

        Often times as well, if you're getting a repair person to do it for you, you do not have to source your own modchip. Shipping those takes time so installers will often have modchips ready on hand to use whenever. Do ask just to be sure.
        :::

        That being said, go with your gut and look around for something / somewhere trustworthy, that'll do a good soldering job and won't just take your Switch. Ask around and weigh out the price, pros and cons.
        If it seems too good to be true, it probably is, if you're unsure about someone, better to be safe than sorry. Stay vigilant.
