title: Unpatched
---

This section will go over homebrewing your unpatched V1 Switch.

---

### Requirements

For all cases:

- [x] An unpatched V1.
- [x] A JIG. ( Can be found on webshops like Amazon ).
- [x] A MicroSD card of your choice.
  - At least 64GB is highly recommended!
  - Buy from a reputable webshop and brand to avoid fakes!

Required extras:

- [x] A PC or laptop.
- [x] A USB-A to USB-C cable to connect your Switch to your PC or laptop.
  - Highly recommended!

OR

- [x] An Android phone or tablet.
- [x] A USB-A to USB-C cable to connect your Switch to your phone or tablet.
- [x] A USB-A adapter to the port on your phone.
  - May not work on every phone or tablet.

:::note[What we recommend]
We recommend to do this process with a PC or laptop as it's easier to do, faster and requires the least amount of parts.
:::

### Before you begin

- [x] You will need to disable automatic backing up of your save data!
  - To do this, go to `Settings` ðŸ † `Data Management` ðŸ † `Save Data Cloud` ðŸ † `Settings` and disable `Automatically Back Up Save Data` and `Automatically Download Save Data`.
- [x] Make sure you back up any data on your MicroSD card!
  - This is important, because your MicroSD will get wiped while homebrewing!
- [x] Make sure your MicroSD card is never formatted as exFAT!
  - exFAT users are more likely to experience SD card corruption than FAT32 users!
- [x] Choose between file based or partition based emuNAND. ( See [this](../miscellaneous/partition-or-file) )

If everything before this point has been done, please select a device / operating system of your choice and inject the payload into your Switch to get into Hekate, after which you need to follow the [global](https://rentry.co/switchsp#global) steps to complete homebrewing your Switch.

### Going into RCM ( recovery ) mode

- Power off Switch completely.

- Take off right joycon.

- Slide in JIG all the way down.

- Press the `Power` button once while holding down `Volume Up`

  - If your Switch displays the Nintendo logo and boots normally ( or the screen was on and goes black ), you didn't successfully enter RCM and should try again. Otherwise, if your console still has a black screen ( even after tapping the power button again ), your Switch is in RCM and you can let go of the `Volume Up` button.

- You're now in RCM mode!

### Download and inject

Choose the device / operating system of choice to download the required files.

        :::note[You can skip this step if you have an RCMLoader]
        :::
            
        - Connect Switch to PC or laptop using the USB cable.

        - On your PC, run `TegraRcmGUI_vx.x_Installer.msi`.

        - Once installed, launch **TegraRcmGUI**. Once it is running, go to the `Settings` tab and click on `Install Driver`.

        - Once the driver is installed, create a folder named `Hekate` on your desktop and extract `hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x_Nyx_x.x.x.zip` into it.

        - Go back to **TegraRcmGUI**, go to the `Payload` tab, press the folder icon, go to the folder named `Hekate` that you made, and pick the file named `hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x.bin`.

        - Inject and you should be in **Hekate**!

        #### Injecting the payload
        :::note[You can skip this step if you have an RCMLoader]
        :::

        - Connect Switch to PC or laptop using the USB cable.

        - On your PC, run the payload injector from your terminal. You will need to run this as root using the `sudo` prefix.

        - Connect your Switch to your PC or laptop using a USB cable.

        - Run Fusee-Nano with `./fusee-nano /path/to/hekate-ctcaer_X.X.X.bin`. This will also need to run as root using the `sudo` prefix.

        - If your payload was successfully injected your switch should have yellow text that says "Update bootloader folder!", this will be resolved soon.

        - Now you should be in Hekate!
