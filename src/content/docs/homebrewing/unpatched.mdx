title: Unpatched
---

import { Card, Steps, FileTree, Tabs, TabItem, LinkCard } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"

This section will go over homebrewing your unpatched V1 Switch. We will be going over how to go into RCM ( recovery mode ), setting up your microSD card,
creating an emulated NAND ( emuNAND / emuMMC ) while also blocking Nintendo's servers so you don't get banned.
    - In order for this guide to work, you explicitly do need an **unpatched V1**, any other Switch will **not** work.

Make sure you have read the Introduction section before doing this, as it contains a lot of important information to homebrewing.

### Firstly

---

<Steps>
1. ###### Disable cloud saves
    - To do this, go to ```Settings``` -> ```Data Management``` -> ```Save Data Cloud``` -> ```Settings``` and disable ```Automatically back up save data``` and ```Automatically download save data```.
2. ###### Backup
    - Make sure you have backed up anything on the microSD card if the card has been used beforehand, because following this guide **will** wipe the microSD card.
</Steps>
---

### Requirements

---

- This ( fantastic ) guide. **:)**
- An unpatched V1 Switch.
- A microSD card of your choice.
  - Read <u>[MicroSD guide](/miscellaneous/microsd/)</u>.
- A ( micro ) SD card reader.
  - You can buy a microSD card reader, you can buy an SD card reader with a microSD to SD adapter, you can use your laptops ( micro ) SD card reader, or maybe even that microSD slot in your phone! *( Not recommended. Android will make folders in the card, which may make it look a bit messy, but it's a way! )*.

    **Whatever works, so long as you have something to access your microSD card.**

**AND**

- An RCM JIG ( can be found on marketplaces like Amazon ).
- A USB cable to connect your Switch to your device.
- A PC or laptop.

**OR**

- A phone or tablet.

**OR**

- An RCMLoader ( can be bought from sites like Amazon and Aliexpress ).

:::note[AutoRCM]
This guide will enable ```AutoRCM``` by default. Once you've used Hekate to enable it, the console from that moment on will always
go into RCM when turned on, making the RCM JIG not needed anymore ( It is needed for the first time and every time you go out of CFW ).

    5. ###### Hekate launch options

        Inside of ```/bootloader/``` on the root of your microSD card, create a file named ```hekate_ipl.ini```.
            - You will need to create a configuration file to set up parameters for Hekate.

        <FileTree>
            - atmosphere/
            - bootloader/
                - **hekate_ipl.ini** Create this file.
            - switch/
            - hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x.bin
            - hbmenu.nro
        </FileTree>

        Copy the bit below and paste it inside of ```hekate_ipl.ini```:
            - You can use the button in the top right of the box in order to copy.

        ```ini
        [config]
        autoboot=0
        autoboot_list=0
        bootwait=3
        backlight=100
        autohosoff=0
        autonogc=1
        updater2p=1
        bootprotect=0

        [emuMMC - CFW]
        fss0=atmosphere/package3
        emummcforce=1
        cal0blank=1
        kip1patch=nosigchk
        icon=bootloader/res/emu_boot.bmp

        [sysMMC - CFW]
        fss0=atmosphere/package3
        kip1=atmosphere/kips/*
        emummc_force_disable=1
        icon=bootloader/res/sys_cfw_boot.bmp

        [Stock - OFW]
        fss0=atmosphere/package3
        stock=1
        emummc_force_disable=1
        icon=bootloader/res/stock_boot.bmp
        ```

        Copy the ```/bootloader/``` folder that is inside of ```bootlogos.zip``` to the root of your microSD card.
        - If asked to overwrite, click yes.

    6. ###### Avoiding a ban

        Inside of the root of your microSD card, create a file named ```exosphere.ini```.

        <FileTree>
        - atmosphere/
        - bootloader/
            - hekate_ipl.ini
        - switch/
        - hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x.bin
        - **exosphere.ini** Create this file.
        - hbmenu.nro
        </FileTree>

        Copy the bit below and paste it inside of ```exosphere.ini```:
            - You can use the button in the top right of the box in order to copy.

        ```ini
        [exosphere]
        debugmode=1
        debugmode_user=0
        disable_user_exception_handlers=0
        enable_user_pmu_access=0
        blank_prodinfo_sysmmc=0
        blank_prodinfo_emummc=1
        allow_writing_to_cal_sysmmc=0
        log_port=0
        log_baud_rate=115200
        log_inverted=0
        ```

    7. ###### Blocking Nintendo connections

        Inside of ```/atmosphere/hosts/``` on the root of your microSD card, create a file named ```default.txt```.

        <FileTree>
        - atmosphere/
            - hosts/
                - **default.txt** Create this file.
        - bootloader/
            - hekate_ipl.ini
        - switch/
        - hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x.bin
        - exosphere.ini
        - hbmenu.nro
        </FileTree>

        Copy the bit below and paste it inside of ```default.txt```:
            - You can use the button in the top right of the box in order to copy.

        ```ini
        # Block Nintendo Servers
        127.0.0.1 *nintendo.*
        127.0.0.1 *nintendo-europe.com
        127.0.0.1 *nintendoswitch.*
        95.216.149.205 *conntest.nintendowifi.net
        95.216.149.205 *ctest.cdn.nintendo.net
        ```

        :::note[Note]
        You can rename the file to ```emummc.txt``` if you **only** want this to apply to emuMMC, if you rename it to ```emummc.txt``` Nintendo connections will **not** be blocked in sysMMC.
        :::

### Injecting A Payload

---
To continue you'll also need:

- An RCM JIG ( can be found on marketplaces like Amazon ).
- A USB cable to connect your Switch to your device.
- A PC or laptop.

**OR**

- A phone or tablet.

**OR**

- An RCMLoader ( can be bought from sites like Amazon and Aliexpress ).

### Start

---

<Steps>
    8. ###### Setting aside payload

        Inside of ```hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x_Nyx_x.x.x.zip``` that you downloaded earlier, there is a file named ```hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x.bin```.

        Copy this file to your desktop or any other directory where you can find it later, you will need it in a bit.

    9. ###### Entering RCM

        To start, place your microSD card inside of your Switch, take off the right joycon and put the RCM JIG on the right rail and slide it all the way down.

        If the Switch is on, turn it off and then power it back on while holding the ```Vol +``` button, this should result in just a black screen.

        If you have a black screen, it means you're in RCM and your Switch is ready to inject.

        :::note[Note]
        For the next step, if, when injecting, nothing happens, your unit may be patched, check [Possibly patched](/homebrewing/possibly-patched/).

### Creating emuMMC

---

Now, you will have to choose between either a partition-based emuMMC or file-based emuMMC, you can read about the differences in <u>[Partition-based or file-based](/miscellaneous/partition/)</u>.

**TLDR:** Partition-based emuMMC is recommended because of it's lower chance of corruption and higher performance, despite being a little harder to back up.
