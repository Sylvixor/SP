title: Unpatched
---

This section will go over homebrewing your unpatched V1 Switch. We will be going over how to go into RCM ( recovery ) mode,
creating an emulated NAND ( emuNAND / emuMMC ) while also blocking Nintendo's servers so you don't get banned.
    - In order for this method to work, you explicitly do need an **unpatched V1**, any other Switch will **not** work.

Make sure you have read the Introduction section before doing this, as it contains a lot of important information to homebrewing.

### First

---

<Steps>
1. ###### Disable cloud saves
    - To do this, go to ```Settings``` -> ```Data Management``` -> ```Save Data Cloud``` -> ```Settings``` and disable ```Automatically back up save data``` and ```Automatically download save data```.
2. ###### Read [Partition-based or file-based](/miscellaneous/partition-or-file/)
    - **TLDR:** Partition-based emuMMC is recommended because of it's lower chance of corruption and higher performance, despite being a little harder to back up.
3. ###### Backup
    - Make sure you have backed up anything on the microSD card if the card has been used beforehand, because following this guide **will** wipe the microSD card.

    ---

</Steps>

:::note[Note]
This guide will enable ```AutoRCM``` by default. Once you've used Hekate to enable it, the console from that moment on will always
go into RCM when turned on, making the RCM JIG not needed anymore ( It is needed for the first time and every time you go out of CFW ).

### MicroSD Card Setup

---

###### For the initial setup you will need:

- This ( fantastic ) guide. :)
- An unpatched V1 Switch.
- A microSD card of your choice.
    - Read [microSD guide](/miscellaneous/microsd/).
- A ( micro ) SD card reader.
    - You can buy a microSD card reader, you can buy an SD card reader with a microSD to SD adapter, you can use your laptops ( micro ) SD card reader. Whatever works, so long as you have something to access your microSD card.

<Steps>
    4. ###### Download the following files:
        <Card title = "Hekate">
            ```hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x_Nyx_x.x.x.zip```

            From their **Github**.
        </Card>
        <Card title = "Atmosphere">
            ```atmosphere-x.x.x-master-xxxxxxxxx+hbl-x.x.x+hbmenu-x.x.x.zip```

            From their **Github**.
        </Card>
        <Card title = "Sigpatches">
            ```sigpatches.zip```

            From their **website**.
        </Card>
    5. ###### Hekate launch options

        Inside of ```/bootloader/``` on the root of your microSD card, create a file named ```hekate_ipl.ini```.
            - You will need to create a configuration file to set up parameters for Hekate.

        <FileTree>
            - atmosphere
            - bootloader
                - **hekate_ipl.ini**
            - switch
            - hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x.bin
            - hbmenu.nro
        </FileTree>

        Copy the bit below and paste it inside of ```hekate_ipl.ini```:
            - You can use the button in the top right of the box in order to copy.

        ```
        [config]
        autoboot=0
        autoboot_list=0
        bootwait=3
        backlight=100
        autohosoff=0
        autonogc=1
        updater2p=1
        bootprotect=0

        [CFW, emuMMC - Atmosphere]
        fss0=atmosphere/package3
        emummcforce=1
        cal0blank=1
        kip1patch=nosigchk
        icon=bootloader/res/icon_payload.bmp

        [Stock]
        fss0=atmosphere/package3
        stock=1
        emummc_force_disable=1
        icon=bootloader/res/icon_switch.bmp
        ```

    6. ###### Avoiding a ban

        Inside of the root of your microSD card, create a file named ```exosphere.ini```.

        <FileTree>
        - atmosphere
        - bootloader
        - switch
        - hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x.bin
        - **hekate_ipl.ini**
        - hbmenu.nro
        </FileTree>

        Copy the bit below and paste it inside of ```exosphere.ini```:
            - You can use the button in the top right of the box in order to copy.

        ```
        [exosphere]
        debugmode=1
        debugmode_user=0
        disable_user_exception_handlers=0
        enable_user_pmu_access=0
        blank_prodinfo_sysmmc=0
        blank_prodinfo_emummc=1
        allow_writing_to_cal_sysmmc=0
        log_port=0
        log_baud_rate=115200
        log_inverted=0
        ```

    7. ###### Blocking Nintendo connections

        Inside of ```/atmosphere/hosts/``` on the root of your microSD card, create a file named ```default.txt```.

        <FileTree>
        - atmosphere
            - hosts
                - **default.txt**
        - bootloader
        - switch
        - hekate_ctcaer_x.x.x.bin
        - hekate_ipl.ini
        - hbmenu.nro
        </FileTree>

        Copy the bit below and paste it inside of ```default.txt```:
            - You can use the button in the top right of the box in order to copy.

        ```
        # Block Nintendo Servers
        127.0.0.1 *nintendo.*
        127.0.0.1 *nintendo-europe.com
        127.0.0.1 *nintendoswitch.*
        95.216.149.205 *conntest.nintendowifi.net
        95.216.149.205 *ctest.cdn.nintendo.net
        ```

        :::note[Note]
        You can rename the file to ```emummc.txt``` if you **only** want this to apply to emuMMC, if you rename it to ```emummc.txt``` Nintendo connections will **not** be blocked in sysMMC.

### Injecting A Payload

---
To continue you'll also need:

- An RCM JIG ( can be found on marketplaces like Amazon ).
- A USB cable to connect your Switch to your device.
- A PC or laptop.

OR

- A phone or tablet.

OR

- A portable payload launcher ( like the RCMLoader ).

### Start

---

<Steps>
    8.  To start, place your microSD card inside of your Switch, take off the right joycon and put the RCM JIG on the right rail and slide it all the way down.

        If the Switch is on, turn it off and then power it back on while holding the ```Vol +``` button, this should result in just a black screen.

        If you have a black screen, it means you're in RCM mode and your Switch is ready to inject.

### Creating emuMMC

---

Now, you will have to choose between either a partition-based emuMMC or file-based emuMMC, you can read about the differences in [partition-based or file-based](/miscellaneous/partition-or-file/) if you still haven't done so.

**TLDR:** Partition-based emuMMC is recommended because of it's lower chance of corruption and higher performance, despite being a little harder to back up.


<Tabs>
    <TabItem label = "Partition-based">
        <Steps>
            11. ###### Partition

                You should now be inside of Hekate. Select the ```Tools``` tab, and then select ```Partition SD card```, and then press ```Ok```.

                Move the emuMMC ( RAW ) slider until it says ```29 FULL```, and then press ```Next Step```, and then press ```Start```.

                Once the operation is done, press ```Close``` and then select the ```Home``` tab.

            12. ###### Create emuMMC

                Select ```emuMMC``` in the main menu, and then select ```Create emuMMC```.

                Select ```SD Partition```, and then select ```Part 1```.

                Wait for your emuMMC to get created. Once it's done, press ```Close```.

                Select the ```Tools``` tab again, and then select ```Archive Bit - AutoRCM``` and pick ```Enable AutoRCM```.

            13. ###### Create backup

                It is recommended to now make a backup, please read [backup / restore](/important/backup/) in order to make a backup using Hekate since you're already in it. Kill two birds with one stone.

### Finishing up

---

<Steps>
    14. On the main menu of Hekate, press ```Launch```, and then select ```emuMMC - Atmosphere CFW``` to launch emuMMC with Atmosphere.

        Otherwise, select ```Stock``` to launch OFW ( can be used for things like online play ).
</Steps>

---

Done! You have now successfully set up Atmosphere on your emuMMC.

Now, if you want to take advantage of CFW on emuMMC, it's recommended to read through:

- [Homebrew app installation](/miscellaneous/hbapp/).
- [USB installation](/miscellaneous/usb-installation/).
- [Manage cheats](/miscellaneous/cheats/).
- [Setup Tesla overlay](/miscellaneous/tesla/).
- [Install themes](/miscellaneous/themes/).
- [Emulating amiibo](/miscellaneous/emuiibo/).
